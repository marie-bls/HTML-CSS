    <p>Hello, it's me
        I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
        To go over everything
        They say that time's supposed to heal ya
        But I ain't done much healing
        Hello, can you hear me?
        I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
        When we were younger and free
        I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
        There's such a difference between us
        And a million miles
        Hello from the other side
        I must've called a thousand times
        To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
        But when I call, you never seem to be home
        Hello from the outside
        At least I can say that I've tried
        To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
        tear you apart anymore</p>
